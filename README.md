first Part of Project: Input for generating 'new business oppotzunities':

a text field for CustomerName should suggest company names during editing (checked
vs a database). If no suggestion is possible a variable IsProspect must be set as false.

How can I program such a text field under xcode 8.0?

 @IBOutlet weak var CustomerName: UITextField!
    
 @IBAction func CustomerNameChg(_ sender: Any) {
        
       
        
       
    }
